# Geeta University Students Test Performance Analysis

As a Data Analyst, I was entrusted by the Geeta Technical Hub (GTH) team at Geeta University with the task of visualizing the performance of BTech students based on their online test submissions. The idea was unique and innovative, aiming to represent their test scores in the form of a Power BI dashboard.

## Details

ðŸ‘‰ This dashboard is a result of analyzing Google Form responses from students who took their tests in a multiple-choice question (MCQ) format. By combining two Excel datasetsâ€”one containing responses and the other containing correct answersâ€”I created a new Excel dataset that could be loaded into Power BI for generating interactive visuals and dashboards.

## Technique Used

ðŸ“Œ Additionally, various functions were employed in Power BI, including:

- Power Query's Pivot/Unpivot Data
- Calculated Measures
- Numerous DAX queries
- Addition of Custom Filters
- Design and Visuals Selection
- Bookmarks

Analyzing students' performance in their tests, both individually and in groups, becomes straightforward through this dashboard.
